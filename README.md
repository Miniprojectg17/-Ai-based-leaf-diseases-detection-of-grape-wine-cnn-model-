Grapevine Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect diseases in grapevine leaves, aiding early identification and effective treatment. The model classifies leaf images into four categories: Black Rot, Esca (Black Measles), Leaf Blight, and Healthy.

Key Highlights:
Dataset: Images of grapevine leaves, preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model: CNN architecture with convolutional layers for feature extraction and softmax output for classification.
Performance: Achieves high accuracy and robustness in identifying leaf diseases.
Usage:
Upload a grapevine leaf image, and the model predicts the disease class, enabling timely intervention to improve crop health and yield.
